> Prefabs and configs for the Atom Controller in the Bespoke software to make your creation process easier.

The [Bespoke Synth](https://www.bespokesynth.com/) software allows one to use their midi devices, but there's no pre-made prefabs or configs built in for the Atom Controller. In here I will add and update my configs that I use with my Atom Controller based off the basic 4x4 pad config, while adding all the dials and other buttons. It will also have full navigation controls, with everything bound to a *global control* node.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This does not yet have every input for the pad mapped yet just the 4x4 and the dials.

> [!TIP]
> Check the Wiki page for install and usage instructions.
***
> [!WARNING]
> There are several known issues, the most notable being the top and bottom row of the pad both play the top and bottom notes regardless of which is hit, unless the left most dial is all the way to the right. Whether this be my hardware or my software, who knows.
