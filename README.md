> A misc set of prefabs and configs for the Presonus Atom Controller in the Bespoke software.

The Bespoke Synth software allows one to use their midi devices, however, there is no pre-made prefabs or configs built in for the Atom Controller. :pensive: So, one must create the configs and do the setup on their own, which could be a pain. In here I will add and update my configs and prefabs that I use with my Atom Controller.
