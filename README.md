> Prefabs and configs for the Atom Controller in the Bespoke software to make your creation process easier.

The [Bespoke Synth](https://www.bespokesynth.com/) software allows one to use their midi devices, however, there is no pre-made prefabs or configs built in for the Atom Controller. So, one must create the configs and do the setup on their own, which could be a pain. In here I will add and update my configs that I use with my Atom Controller based off the basic 4x4 pad config, while adding all the dials and other buttons. I also have some relatively simple prefabs that allow you to drag them in, and start playing! All of this is meant to give simple integration with the Atom Controller ideally including every feature of it including the colors, though I don't believe colors will work, and making it easy to use and modify. Feel free to use this project to modify it for your own pads, or add anything you want to the project.

> [!WARNING]
> There are several known issues, the most notable being the top and bottom row of the pad both play the top and bottom notes regardless of which is hit, unless the left most dial is all the way to the right. Like what?
